# new data type , complex which means
# its name complex instead of int and
# float we have this type for number
#  bin()
# print binary number 0b101 - which is 5
# print(bin(5))
# # this will return value of 5
# print(int('0b101', 2))
# print(int('0b101', 2))
#
# Variables
# all programming languages have variable
# lets say we have a program that store
# iq is a variable
# your IQ is 200
# iq = 190
# now we print id , it will be used , printed out
# print(id)
# remember variables are case sensitive
# in python dont overwrite , dont use it again
# dont overwrite , dont use a keyword for a variable
# user_id = 100
# print(user_id)
# iq = 170
# user_age = iq/4
# a = user_age
# print(user_age)
#
# Constants
# a constants  does not change
# PI = 3.14
# PI = 0
# print(PI)
# a,b,c = 1,2,3
# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(c)
#
# Expression vs Statement
# if we create a piece of code here
#  iq / 5 is the expression part of the
# it's a piece of code , which produces
# a value  100 / 5 equals 20
# a statement on the other hand , is an
# entire line  of code  userr_age = iq / 5
# an entire line of code that performs som
# sort of action
#  code in action
# iq = 190
# user_age = iq / 5
# print(user_age)
#
# Augmented Assignment operator
# allows us to do some quite neat
# example , it does what it is doing, understand?
# add a value to another
# some_value = 10
# some_value = some_value + 20
# print(some_value)
# instead of a# add a value to another
# # some_value = 10
# # some_value = some_value + 20
# # print(some_value)
# # instead of above , below short hand  augmented  +=
# #
# some_value = 10
# some_value += 2
# print(some_value) above , below short hand  augmented  +=
# works as * , + - . so on
#
#  code in action
# some_value = 5
# some_value += 2
# print(some_value)
#
#  strings  - str
# a sting is a piece of text for example , a string
#  can b written with quotation or double quotes
# Its a piece of text
#  print(bin()) prints binary number
# Complex number
# use 2 for base for binary number
# print(int('0b101', 2))
# using variable exampole
# const example with variable

# ab = 3.14
# ab = 2*3

# Lets define a simple function that calculates
# and display the results
# a rectangles  area , we will use the keyword def
#  use def to define a new keyword name for our function
# descriptive keyword , since the goal and purpose of our
# function is to calculate  Lets name it
#  name it  cal_rect_area - functions  name
#
#
# next we follow the functions name with parenthesis ()
# function that
# Calculates a rectangle area
# Displays results
# def calc_rect_area()
# input function needs to perform it task
# area requires in length and width , we can write
#
# inside is the () is the function input
# finally we end the line a colon
# next after is feature  with the next line is indented
# Lets know fill in the line of the body of the function

# the first thing we have in every programming language
# reserved words , the first thing we have in every

# reserved words in python , use them that pythong

# we cant make up a variable named in reserved words
# reserved words  example
# False await else import pass
# reserved words are like words / communication to
# talk to a dog - lets go for a walk - the dog
# understand walk , similar  to reserved  words
