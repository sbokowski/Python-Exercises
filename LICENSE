 Fair Use:

Fair use is a legal concept that allows for limited use of copyrighted material 
without permission for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, 
scholarship, or research.
Whether the use of code from a tutorial constitutes fair use is determined on a
case-by-case basis and depends on factors like the purpose and character of the use, 
the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, 
and the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
    For educational purposes: If you are following a tutorial to learn and recreate 
the code for educational purposes, it is generally considered acceptable and may 
fall under fair use.
