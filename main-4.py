# print some strings

# print() function

#
# variable naming
# now, the final thing to remember is that if you decide
# to call your variable a name ,
some_name = "Jackson"
length = len(some_name)
print(length)
#
student_name = "alexander"
length = len(student_name)
print(length)

# later on, when you want to use this piece of data, you
# use this name to refer to it.
#
#   input function
#
input("Are you ready to go? ")
print("Lets go now")

# the input function input()  input("a prompt for the user")
# The input function looks pretty much identical to the
#  print function , instead of the word print
# and in some places you want even see a cursor until  you
# click into the output area for user
#
# so , what can we do with this data inside our code
# Now that way this works is when this line run by
# the computer , it takes your command as understanding
# that you want the user
#
#  input("Whats the name of the  game?")
# so somebody to be able tok you want the user to be able
# to type in an input and this area and whatever
#
# june 2 2025
# input() function
# and then onece it in their, the print function is going
# to carry out the role and is going to add
# the hello , the user types , the wil replace  the
# hightligh  place - it wil end up with hello plus
# concatenate . so we click this area, your cursor starts
#  flashing , then we con type some test into the place
# add an exclamation to
# input() functin how to
# print("Greetings " + input("what is your name. ") + "!")
#
# To find the length of a character in Python , we need
# to clarify the term ,
# the length of a string , which contain mulit characters
# you use the built in len() , len(name-of_string)
# len() find how many characters
# name = ("Jack in the bed went quietly")
# print(len(name))
# #
text = "dorito chips"
print(len(text))
#
# switch variables  with 3 lines of code
glass1 = "milk"
milk = "glass1"
print(milk)
#
#  Exercise Band name generator
# Make a title for Band name generator
 # Ask what name of city you grew up in?
 # add a \n to the end of sentence so text show
 # on the next line so your program looks more orgainized
#
# print("Welcome to The Band Name Generator")
# city = input("Which city did you grow up in? \n ")
# pet = input("What is the name of a pet? \n ")
# print("Your band name could be: " + city + " " + pet)

# input value will be lost if you dont append a value to it
# now we have access to the city , we can use it later
#  so we call what city to city = to assign what the user
# typed , then i can print it use it later on
# then we want to assign your pen name to a variable so we
# can use it later to put the variables together
# next to combine the name  of the city and the pet and
# display and show them their band name.
# by using the string concatenation - put 2 strings into one
#
# Next lesson onward
# using the print(len('Character count"))
#
# print(len("Hello my darling"))
# print(len("Yes , we can do that"))
# use numbers ,what happens not quotes
# error saying type error
# TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()
# print(len(12234))
# question  what will happen if we use numbers,
# instead  of letters
#
# Data types  String , Integer , floats ,
# boolean - type of data types
#
# Remember we start counting from 0 in binary
# sub scripting -
# So this metod of pulling out certain element
# from a string is called sub scripting and the
# nunber in between the square brackets determines
# the character you are picking out.
